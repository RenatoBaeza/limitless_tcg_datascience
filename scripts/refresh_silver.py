"""Rebuild the silver layer from bronze.

Cheap and safe to run as often as you like: the refresh is a full reconcile,
not an append, so re-running only bumps refreshed_at. It reads all of bronze
every time rather than just what is new, because a pairing's deck columns are
filled in by a standings ingest that lands later than the pairing itself.

Run it after the ingests, not before - it can only reflect what bronze already
has. See app/silver.py for the loop and sql/005_silver.sql for the transform.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/refresh_silver.py [--dry-run]
    uv run python scripts/refresh_silver.py --only pairings
    uv run python scripts/refresh_silver.py --tournament <id>
