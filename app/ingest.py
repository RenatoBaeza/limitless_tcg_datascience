"""Shared driver for the per-tournament ingests (pairings, standings).

Both resources have the same shape of problem: one API call per tournament,
a hard rate limit, and far more tournaments than fit in a single run. The loop
below is the part that must behave identically for both - budgeting, pacing,
resume-on-restart and per-tournament fault isolation - so it lives here rather
than being copied per script.
