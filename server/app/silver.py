"""Driver for the bronze -> silver refresh.

The transform itself is two Postgres functions (sql/005_silver.sql); this
module only calls them. Keeping the work server-side is the whole point:
silver_pairings is derived from ~290k bronze rows joined twice against
standings, and dragging that through PostgREST to reshape it in Python would
spend minutes of transfer on what Postgres does in place in seconds.

Work is submitted a batch of tournaments at a time rather than as one call over
the whole table. That keeps any single statement well inside the database's
timeout, bounds how much a failure costs, and gives the run something to print
while it works. The functions are full reconciles of whatever slice they are
handed, so a batch that fails is simply redone by the next run.
