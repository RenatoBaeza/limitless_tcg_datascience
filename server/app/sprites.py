"""Build the deck sprite assets a frontend serves out of public/.

Every deck in silver carries `deck_icons`: the Pokemon whose sprites Limitless
draws beside that deck's name. Those icon names are exactly the filenames on
Limitless's sprite CDN - the same images https://limitlesstcg.com/decks renders
in its table - so the deck-to-sprite mapping is already in the database and
does not have to be scraped back off that page and re-matched by deck name.

A run writes two things into --out (default public/decks):

    <deck_id>.png        one file per deck, its icons composited side by side
    index.json           deck id -> display name, icons, and image path

The individual Pokemon sprites those composites are built from land in
--sprite-cache instead, outside the frontend's public/ directory and outside
git. They are ingredients, not assets: every one of their pixels also lives in
at least one composite, and half the decks have a single icon, so their
"composite" is that one sprite re-saved. Nothing serves them, so shipping them
would send the browser a second copy of every image it already has. The cache
exists only so a re-run refetches nothing - deleting it costs one redownload.

Files are keyed on `deck_id` rather than on the deck name, for two reasons.
Names are not unique - two unrelated decks are both called "Alakazam" - so
name-keyed files would silently overwrite each other. And `deck_id` is what
silver_pairings already carries in winner_deck_id / loser_deck_id, so a
frontend holding a pairing row also holds the key to its image. The display
name is in index.json for anything that wants to render it.

The deck list is read off silver_standings, the only silver table carrying the
icons. That is a superset of the decks in silver_pairings, which take their
decks from standings by join, so every deck named in a pairing has an image.

Rate limiting is not a concern here: the sprites come from Limitless's asset
CDN, not from the play.limitlesstcg.com API that RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL paces.
