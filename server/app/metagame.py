"""Read side of the gold layer - the questions the frontend asks.

Every answer is already a row in gold (sql/012_gold_finished.sql, reshaped by
sql/014_fixed_view.sql): the refresh
computes each period's deck table and matchup cells once, so a read here is a
PostgREST filter on a primary key and nothing is summed, ranked or rated at
request time. The columns are selected under the names the response models use,
so rows pass straight through.

The view is fixed apart from the period. Gold holds no 'other' rows at all
(sql/014), every cell with at least one match is returned - a thin cell is
told apart by its Wilson interval, not hidden - and the axis is TOP_DECKS.

Two things this module owns that the router should not:

`_client` - one httpx.Client for the process. The service is long-lived, so
reconnecting per request would throw away the connection pool.

`_cached` - a short time-to-live memo. Gold is rebuilt every six hours, so a
result is good for far longer than the 5 minutes cached here. The point is a
frontend where flipping a filter re-asks the same handful of questions.
